One of the best places to look for privilege escalation is the processes that are running on the system. Even if a process is not running as an administrator, it may lead to additional privileges.
The most common example is discovering a web server like "IIS" or "XAMPP" running on the box, placing an aspx/php shell on the box, and gaining a shell as the user running the web server.
Generally, this is not an administrator but will often have the SeImpersonate token, allowing for Rogue/Juicy/Lonely Potato to provide SYSTEM permissions.
